repeat('A', 5);
//=> AAAAA
```

## Benchmarks

<<<<<<< HEAD
Repeat string is significantly faster than the native method (which is itself faster than [repeating](https://github.com/sindresorhus/repeating)):

  repeating x 9,051,715 ops/sec ±1.18% (90 runs sampled)

#2: 50
  native x 7,975,566 ops/sec ±1.29% (91 runs sampled)
  repeat-string x 15,317,972 ops/sec ±1.16% (87 runs sampled)
  repeating x 6,279,112 ops/sec ±1.29% (89 runs sampled)
