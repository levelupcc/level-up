## About LevelUp

LevelUp supports individuals and groups providing digital security trainings and support worldwide. It is a living project by and for the training community for the benefit of all trainers and training organizations, and invites contributions and feedback from trainers, as well as re-use, re-mixes, and creative adaptation as needed in the training room. LevelUp's resources and events will continue to reflect the feedback, input, and contributions of the wider digital safety training community as well as subject matter experts.

During its pilot year, LevelUp was overseen and coordinated by Internews, with support and input from more than 50 individuals and their organizations. We'd like to thank them for seeing the value of this project and supporting its goals (and the larger training community) with their expertise, time, and insight. We'd like to particularly acknowledge NDI's ICT Team and the Tactical Technology Collective, as well as the engine room, who conducted research to inform the project. LevelUp hosted several events in its pilot year, including two training-of-trainer events, a design workshop, writesprints, and more. We plan to hold the first Global Trainers' Retreat in 2014.

LevelUp emerged at a time when the demand for digital security trainers has far outstripped the supply. The most experienced digital security trainers are often overworked, overbooked, and under-resourced. They often find themselves as the go-to resource for far more users and organizations in need than they are able to support due to structural support gaps. In addition, a number of individuals are being asked to become digial safety trainers with little to no support, guidance, training experience, or ethical framework. This project aims to help all digial safety trainers, from novices to experts, by supporting the creation of a centralized collection of resources by experienced trainers, creating opportunities for trainers to come together at events, and the development of tools for the training room.

This website is the result of over a year of work by members of the digital safety training community (and supporting subject experts) volunteering their time, energy, expertise, and insight to create a shared repository for all trainers.

We'd like to thank all the contributors and supporters of this project (both public and unnamed) -- the resources here aren't possible without your insight, work, and support. We'd also like to thank the RFK Centre in Florence for providing LevelUp with housing and a venue for two events during its pilot year.
