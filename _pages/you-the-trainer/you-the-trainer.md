title: "You, The Trainer"
author: Nick Sera-Leyva, Carol Waters
summary: Every trainer is stronger in some areas than in others; however, the best are constantly seeking new ways to improve their skills. 
Some trainers focus too heavily on the technical details of content; others are amazing at leading activities, but leave participants with little understanding of how tools and practices can make them “safer.” In the worst case scenarios, participants feel alienated from the subject (or the trainer), don’t enjoy themselves, or the workshop leaves them further confused. We've gathered insight and learnings from trainers around the world, and have distilled these into a collection of helpful resources to help digital security trainers consider their personal growth and development.
