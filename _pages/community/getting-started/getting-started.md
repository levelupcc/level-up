# How You Can Use LevelUp

## 1. Explore advice and insight from the global trainer network
*We've gathered insight and learnings from trainers around the world, and have distilled these into a collection of helpful resources across a range of topics relevant to the context of digital security trainers.*

From [training session modules](/level-up/curriculum/), how-to guides for [planning events](/level-up/before-an-event/planning-your-training-event/) and [event agendas](/level-up/before-an-event/planning-your-event-agenda/), guidance on [facilitation aids](/level-up/you-the-trainer/ice-breakers-and-energizers/) and [techniques](/level-up/you-the-trainer/be-a-better-trainer/), and introductory resources on [holistic security](/level-up/before-an-event/creating-safe-spaces/) and [psychosocial well-being](/level-up/before-an-event/psychosocial-underpinnings-of-security-training/), this evolving compendium of advice and experience is available for all trainers to freely remix, reuse, and adapt under a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

[You, The Trainer](/levelup/you-the-trainer/)
Every trainer is stronger in some areas than in others; however, the best are constantly seeking new ways to improve their skills. These resources reflect the experience of a number of trainers in this regard.

[Before an Event](/levelup/before-an-event/)
Arguably the most critical phase of the training planning process takes place before the event itself. This multi-part resource details the basics, built from the documented experience of several experienced trainers.
<br><br>

## 2. Craft custom trainings using our shared Training Curriculum
*Core to LevelUp is its *created by trainers, for trainers* curriculum of shared digital security training modules, developed from the experience of active digital safety trainers, and available to freely remix, reuse, and adapt under a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

LevelUp uses the **Activity-Discussion-Inputs-Deepening-Synthesis**, or **ADIDS** approach, to gear these modules towards the needs of adult learners and has organized its curriculum around this design. For trainers, it can provide a useful framework when creating lesson plans and training agendas.

[How To: Using the LevelUp Trainers Curriculum](/level-up/before-an-event/using-levelup-trainers-curriculum/)
Each of LevelUp's curriculum modules are designed around a topic-based training session - this resource explains the basic structure of a session module, and the logic behind this structure.

[Planning Your Event Agenda](/level-up/before-an-event/planning-your-event-agenda/)
This resource features advice from a number of experienced digital security trainers on preparing agendas for your training events. It has been broken down into several main resources that can be used as planning aids for workshops.
