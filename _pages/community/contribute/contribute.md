#### Core to LevelUp is an ethos of community ownership - the content on this site is *your* content, and  it is meant to reflect your effort and experience as a member of the training community.

This site was created to provide a sustained repository of resources, created by trainers for their peers, that can continue to be used and relied on. LevelUp relies on contributions and feedback from members of the training community, like you, to remain an evolving, up-to-date, and most importantly, *shared* resource.

## How Can I Provide Feedback?
There are a few different ways you can provide feedback on LevelUp's growing compendium of digital security training content. We're actively looking into what further options we can make available in the near future; however, please see our current feedback channels below.

### 1. Submit Feedback via Email

##### Email us at [levelup@riseup.net](mailto: levelup@riseup.net) ([GPG public key here](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x207BFB9591A638BE))
LevelUp is cared for by trusted members of the training community, who are dedicated to maintaining the resource and staying engaged with its users.

<br><br>

### 2. Annotate and Discuss Content with Hypothes.is

##### LevelUp now uses [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) - a free and open source annotation plug-in - that allows users to comment and notetake on LevelUp content - directly on the site.

To begin using Hypothes.is, click the grey arrow <img src="/assets/images/hypothesis-bar-arrow.PNG"> in the upper right corner of any page on the LevelUp site (see image below) to expand the menu sidebar. Here, you can either log-in or sign up.

*New users will need to create an account; however, the Hypothes.is team maintains [extremely transparent and privacy-friendly Terms of Service](https://hypothes.is/terms-of-service/).*

<img src="/assets/images/hypothesis-toolbar.PNG">

To leave a comment, simply highlight/select the text you would like to comment on - this icon will then appear over the text:

<img src="/assets/images/hypothesis-annotate-highlight.PNG">

...from which you can choose to leave a comment (Annotate) or simply Highlight the text - select an option, and the Hypothes.is tool bar will expand to display the comment editor.

To toggle your comment privacy settings between **Public** or **Private**, click on the <img src="/assets/images/hypothesis-eye-sm.PNG"> icon, which will change to <img src="/assets/images/hypothesis-eye-sm-pvt.PNG"> when **Private** is enabled. Any comment or response that you leave can be either public to all users, or private to yourself only.

In addition to leaving new comments, you can also engage in discussion with other users of LevelUp, by selecting their public comments and leaving a response.

For more in-depth details on using Hypothes.is, see our [mini-tutorial and walkthrough here](https://github.com/levelupcc/level-up/wiki/How-to-Use-Hypothesis#how-do-you-use-it).

### 2. Submit Content as a Pull Request on GitHub

##### LevelUp now uses [GitHub](https://github.com/levelupcc) to edit and manage the content of this website.

This also means that all content can now be found, in [markdown (.md) format](https://github.com/levelupcc/level-up/wiki/How-to-work-with-Markdown), via the [public LevelUp GitHub repository](https://github.com/levelupcc). To make using this option easier for all users, we've created a series of mini-tutorials which detail the process:

#### [Using GitHub to Contribute Content>>](https://github.com/levelupcc/level-up/wiki/How-to-Add-Content#adding-a-new-community-resource)
Contribute to the [community resources section](/community/community-resources-and-tools/) of the Level Up website.

#### [Using GitHub to Edit Existing Content>>](https://github.com/levelupcc/level-up/wiki/How-to-Edit-Content)
Submit edits or updates to existing content.

#### [Using GitHub to Add New Content Pages>>](https://github.com/levelupcc/level-up/wiki/How-to-Add-Content#adding-a-new-page)
Submit new pages for module, how-tos, and other resources.
<br><br>

### 3. Contribute to Content Localization on Transifex

##### LevelUp now uses [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/otf/level-up-website/) to advance the localization of its content into more languages.

We want LevelUp to be accessible in many different ways, to many different people - this involves not only having its content *translated* in more languages, but also *localized* to the context of trainers who speak and train in those languages.

Content for localization is currently hosted on the [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/otf/level-up-website/) platform, which has helped our efforts to begin localizing LevelUp into Spanish and Arabic, with more languages on the way.

##### We've also partnered with [Localization Lab](http://www.localizationlab.org/) to explore ways of not only getting LevelUp localized, but to involve the training community directly in that process; through events like [Localization Sprints](http://www.localizationlab.org/2016-localization-summit-and-sprint-summary), we've gotten a steady start.

Email us at [levelup@riseup.net](mailto: levelup@riseup.net) ([GPG public key here](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x207BFB9591A638BE)) if you're interested in supporting the localization of LevelUp.
<br><br>

## What Can I Contribute?
The content on LevelUp is varied and currently includes [training session modules](/curriculum/), how-to guides for [planning events](/before-an-event/planning-your-training-event/) and [event agendas](/before-an-event/planning-your-event-agenda/), guidance on [facilitation aids](/you-the-trainer/ice-breakers-and-energizers/) and [techniques](/you-the-trainer/be-a-better-trainer/), and introductory resources on [holistic security](/before-an-event/creating-safe-spaces/) and [psychosocial well-being](/before-an-event/psychosocial-underpinnings-of-security-training/), but is expanding to include more.

### Here's what we receive the most requests for:

#### New Training Modules
Your own training module for a specific topic, tool, or practice, that you've found useful and would like to share with other trainers.

#### Module Adaptations
An existing LevelUp module useful, but adapted or altered for a certain context or audience.

#### Module Additions
New Activity & Discussion, Input, Deepening, or Synthesis element(s) that you'd like to add to an existing module.

#### More Icebreakers & Energizers
Activities and games for starting trainings, building trust between participants, explaining or demonstrating technology, and re-energizing participants when energy is low.

#### Modules or Resources on Physical & Holistic Security
New or original content, that addresses key aspects of physical security, situational awareness, and self-care and wellbeing, which trainers can either build in their own events or use to raise their own awareness of these considerations.

##### *Reminder: The above contains only some examples of content that we've received requests for; if you'd like to submit something that doesn't fall into one of the above categories, we're still interested in receiving it!*
