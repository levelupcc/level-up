<br><br>

##Learning Goals for Participants##


- Become more aware of the trade-offs of social networking services in order to make more informed choices.
- Review the privacy and security options and settings of popular social networking sites.
- Consider how the information they share about themselves, others, and their networks can be used and misused.
- Be aware of the priorities and incentives of the companies who own social networking sites, as well as how governments can compel these companies to take down data or give it to government officials.

## Important Notes ##

- **This is one of the most fast-evolving topics**, due to the constant updates to social networking tools, their policies, and how they are used. Keep your knowledge up-to-date and adjust your trainings as needed, especially to include any vulnerabilities.

- **Find out what your participants use** before you put together your training, and what their primary concerns, issues and questions may be (if any). Use this to tailor your session.

- **Preferences for particular social networking tools and services varies widely.** Included here are some of the most common social networking tools, but it is by no means representative of what is used worldwide. After you find out what your participants use before the training, if there is a social networking tool or service that you're unfamiliar with, do the legwork to research the tool before putting together this session.
