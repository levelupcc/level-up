summary: "This activity will help illustrate which kinds of information participants may not want to share on social media, and their inability to control information once it's been posted and reused by someone else. Shared information might be altered by others in uncontrollable ways, and that those who receive the information you share may be untrustworthy."

## Materials to Prepare ##

- Index cards and pens

- **Suggested:** Since there's a substantial lag while the participant who creates the message writes it out and addresses it to three people, you can ask them to write them out and give the trainer the names of three recipients before the session starts.

## Running the Activity ##

- Select one participant who should come up with a unique message that is funny or outrageous, but not to share it.

- Ask them to write the message on one side of three cards, leaving the other side of the cards blank.

- Ask them to also think of three participants that they want to message to go to.

- The participant will give the cards to the trainer and tell the trainer the names of the three participants without sharing them with the entire group.

- The Trainer will secretly write "share this with one other person nearby after reading" on one of the cards, or they can tell one of the participants secretly when they hand them the card.

- The trainer explains to the group that they are representing Facebook and will deliver the messages to the three people chosen by the author.

- The trainer delivers 3 cards to the three participants.

- The participants read the message, and one of them shares the message with a neighbor.

- After the messages have been delivered and read, the trainer asks: "who knows what the message said?"

- Four trainees will raise their hand.

## Leading the Discussion ##

When the participant is (hopefully!) surprised, the trainer will ask who the messages were originally meant to go to.

**Ask the fourth recipient to explain how they go the message.**

*You can ask the following questions of the trainees:*

- What kind of control do you have when you share information online?

- Do privacy settings help? In which ways can they help? In which ways can they not help?

- Has anyone ever posted or shared something online that they didn't mean to share?

- If so, how did they deal with it?
