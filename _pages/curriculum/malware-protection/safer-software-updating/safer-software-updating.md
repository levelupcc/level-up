## Important Notes
A common challenge for participants trying to update their system is a slow Internet connection. If this is the case, suggest that users find solutions such as downloading updates overnight or using hotel WiFi access. Sharing software on flash drives is not recommended as these drives can become infected. Participants may be embarrassed to discuss pirating software - if this appears to be the case, avoid singling out individuals as examples of piracy.
