## Running the Session:

### Part 1 – Have You Used Encryption Before?
**Step 1 |** Explain that this is an introductory session for encryption as a concept, so you will not yet be going into great depth on any of the encryption tools that participants have likely heard about before (GPG/PGP in particular). 
<br><br>
**Step 2 |** Split participants up into pairs, and then start the session by demonstrating a few examples of encryption techniques. Here are a few examples that you can prepare ahead of time to share with the group:
<br><br>

#### *The BLUEPRINTS Code*
Each of the letters in the word Blueprints is assigned a number: *placeholder for BLUEPRINTS (original order) image*

This is a specific example using a specific word, but can be broadly applied to any number and letter sequence - for instance, if you use the same system as above, the sequence of numbers **8 2 5 7 9** would spell **T U R N S** when “decrypted”. You could also switch the order of the numbers, so that instead of the above sequence, it now goes: *placeholder for BLUEPRINTS (switched order) image*

In this instance, the sequence of numbers **8 2 5 7 9** would now spell **L N P U B** (which isn’t a word) when “decrypted”; however, you could now “decrypt” the sequence **4 3 2 0 6** as **R I N S E**.
<br><br>

#### *Old-Fashioned Text Messaging*
Use an image of an older-style phone keypad (see below) to demonstrate another kind of “encryption” that participants may be familiar with: *placeholder for keypad image*

Ask participants how they would use this keypad to spell different words – one example you could use would be to have each participant explain how they would use the keypad to spell their name. 

For instance, a participant named Luisa would spell her named by typing the sequence **5 5 5 8 8 4 4 4 7 7 7 7 2**.
<br><br>

**Step 3 |** Once you’ve completed the above examples, ask participants if they have ever used other kinds of encryption – either like the above, or any other examples they can think of (e.g. a common instance of encryption used by many people every day is HTTPS).
<br><br>
**Step 4 |** Close this part of the session by following-up with another question: What are the common elements they can identify from these different examples of encryption?
<br><br> 	 	
**Step 5 |** Keep in mind that some email services such as Gmail have to be configured to allow the use of Thunderbird as a third party application.
<br><br>

### Part 2 – Explaining Encryption
**Step 6 |** Building on the common elements of encryption identified by participants in Part 1, you should now expand on some further basics and practices for the group:
- **Encryption Methods:** Take time to explain how encryption works, referring back to the examples from Part 1 as well as by showing a few example screenshots of what a GPG-encrypted email looks like. Highlight common implementations of encryption – in particular, spend time reviewing HTTPS, end-to-end encryption and GPG/PGP encryption. 	
- **Keys and Keypairs:** Explain how encryption keypairs work, and the algorithmic relationship between public and private keys. Go back through the example implementations previously mentioned (HTTPS, end-to-end and GPG/PGP) and explain for each of these where their respective keys are stored and/or visible to the user.
- **Encryption Practices:** Highlight some of the critical best practices associated with common implementations of encryption, such as fingerprint verification and key-signing. To demonstrate, ask participants to locate where within Signal one can verify another user’s fingerprint; similarly, if participants already have GPG/PGP keys you can discuss the benefits and disadvantages of signing and distributing public keys. This is also a good time to discuss end-to-end encrypted messaging for chat apps such as Signal, Telegram and Whatsapp – remind participants that end-to-end encryption on some of these services is not always enabled by default.
- **Encrypted Backups:** Building off the GPG/PGP example above, ask participants whether they think it is a good idea to backup their GPG private key, and if so, how might they go about doing so?
